                <p>Life is a series of connected choices that determine the shape of a journey. I started my journey
                    into higher education in 2011 when I pursued a passion major. I studied contemporary music and audio
                    engineering. I put these skills to work as a professional musician for many years. During this time,
                    I witnessed many friends fall prey to substance abuse and I simultaneously started to become
                    disillusioned by the music industry. This led me to reevaluate my life’s trajectory and go back to
                    college. Settling on Psychology as my major area of study, with a minor in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>Right away I loved the psychology classes that I took, and immediately saw how widely applicable it
                    could be to almost any field. In Psych 101 intro to psychology , I did a project based on a
                    behavioral psychology experiment called “Death Squared, the Explosive Growth & Demise
                    of a Mouse Population.” This study of mice populations under different circumstances had a strong
                    application to the way human society functions and operates. Though not demonstrated in this
                    project, this class introduced me to the well-known concepts of classical and operant conditioning.
                    These concepts are still today a crucial part in understanding why addiction in all its forms
                    remains such a plague on the human condition.
                </p>
                <p>Another artifact that demonstrates an important stage in my education was my paper on Opioid
                    Addiction. I wrote this paper for a class called Physiological Psychology. The class examined the
                    neuroscience behind psychology topics, how the brain works, and why it does what it does. This paper
                    was ostensibly a literature review, but it showcased my ability to critically think about complex
                    subjects and read very scientifically dense research papers in order to synthesize a more succinct
                    analysis of a topic. This topic is one that has become a major issue around the world as the opioid
                    crisis rages on. Despite all the news articles and attention, it has garnered, most people do not
                    understand even slightly how addiction happens in the brain. This class and this artifact allowed me
                    to write what I think is an important piece that can help people destigmatize opioid addiction and
                    stop looking at drug addicts as criminals, but sick people who need medical intervention, not jail.
                </p>
                <p>To further my understanding of why people behave the way they do I took a cognitive psychology class
                    here at the University of Washington Bothell. While I did not write any papers in this class that
                    could be counted as artifacts, it was a critically important class that deepened my interest in the
                    study of the human mind. Psychology is a very broad field and there are a large number of
                    disciplines within its breadth. After taking this class I began to see myself following a path
                    further down the discipline of cognitive studies, or at least fields that could benefit from an
                    understanding of it. The human mind is infinitely complex and during this class I saw many
                    correlations between the human mind and computer science. Both of these intricate systems of
                    information aggregation, compilation, and output rely on patterns and predefined systems of
                    “hardware” and “software” and are often mimetic of each other. The software in your smartphone
                    relies on hardware, central processing unit, graphical processing unit, and memory storage devices
                    to name a few. The brain also has these in the form of organic components which are too many in
                    number to list here. In computer science software relies on algorithms, logic, and APIs to
                    communicate with hardware and generate all these user interfaces and functional programs we enjoy,
                    like this application, Microsoft Word. The brain also uses these systems. Syllogisms or heuristics
                    being excellent examples. Our central nervous system and neurotransmitters are very much like API’s.
                    Allowing the brain to send and receive information.
                </p>
                <p>Between my sophomore and junior year, I seemingly fell into an internship working as a network
                    technician. During this time, I learned about everything from network circuit functionality to the
                    suite of internet protocols that allow the world wide web to operate. It was this internship that
                    sparked my interest in computer science and IT. I taught myself basic coding using languages like
                    HTML and JavaScript. I quickly decided to minor in computer science afterwards. The intro class CSS
                    142, which covered the basic principles of coding using the Java language as a foundation, was
                    immensely fun to take. I quickly learned that not only was I very interested in the subject matter,
                    but I had an aptitude for it. In this class I completed various projects, such as creating a
                    program to draw images and polygons based on mathematical input values. This class demonstrated my
                    ability to think logically and learn complex new topics quickly. Learning to code is very akin to
                    learning a new language. Even after learning the basics of how to use logic structures to
                    communicate with a binary computer via higher level program languages, you still must learn the
                    syntax of a language, or many languages. Java does not have the same key words and syntax as C++ or
                    JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>An important class I took during this time was CSS 310, Information Assurance and Cybersecurity. This
                    class combined my working background in networking and IT with my coding ability, and even
                    incorporated my knowledge and interests in psychology. Cybersecurity is a combination of all these
                    three components. You must understand how networks operate, you must understand how coding works,
                    and you must understand the psychology of how humans behave and what motivates them. The most common
                    cybersecurity breaches begin with what is called social engineering attacks. This is in practice an
                    exercise of psychological manipulation, playing on a target’s motivations or behaviors to expose a
                    vulnerability and exploit it. This class, this choice, changed my desired life trajectory. I saw a
                    way to incorporate my psychology major, computer science minor, and my network experience all into
                    one career, cybersecurity. In this class I had to complete some challenging “Whitehat” hacking
                    exercises, demonstrating my knowledge of internet protocols, JavaScript, Unix commands and directory
                    navigation, and HTML. Even my cognitive psychology knowledge aided me in completing this challenge.
                    Recognizing that people tend to use patterns when it comes to things like making passwords or
                    structuring their security mechanisms without even realizing they are doing it, makes find
                    vulnerabilities easier. In cognitive psychology this would be an example of system 1 thinking, or
                    mental shortcuts that make up roughly 98% of all our thought processes. Our brains unconsciously use
                    ease to access information or patterns to make quick decisions. Hackers can take advantage of this
                    when it comes to looking for vulnerabilities in a person’s security.
                </p>
                <p>My life has been a zig zag between different areas of interest. My college experience at UW was not a
                    deviation from this pattern. But I don’t view this as a bad thing. Part of going through undergrad,
                    maybe the most important part for many, is finding out what you want to do. There are always avenues
                    to change direction later, you could choose to double major, pivot to a grad program that is more in
                    line with what you want or pursue certifications that will enable you to work in your field of
                    interest. I started off not knowing what to study and I changed direction a few times, but those
                    choices allowed me to find something I enjoy and build a career out of. I believe finding an
                    area that you not only excel in but take pleasure in as well can be a huge factor in a successful
                    career.
