                        <p class="lead">
                        <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>My name is Lucas Zemlin. Describing oneself is always difficult, but I’ll try to be succinct.
                            I grew up in Kirkland, WA. I graduated from Lake Washington High School in 2010 and pursued
                            a career in music. After a few years I realized that making my music into a business was
                            taking away from my enjoyment of playing. I made the decision to go back to college. You’ll
                            read about all that later though!
                        </p>
                        <p>As a person I like to remain active with hobbies. I still to this day compose and record
                            music, both collaboratively and on my own. Among my other hobbies are hiking, web
                            development, gaming, and reading. I’ve moved around, but I currently live in Kirkland, WA
                            again with my partner Sara and our kitten Timon.</p>

                        <p class="lead">
                        <p>My first instrument was the piano whereas a child I learned the basics. In Junior High I
                            joined the concert and jazz bands playing the trombone. I started taking private guitar
                            lessons around this time for I quickly found I preferred it to the trombone. When I left
                            home, I moved to Portland, OR to study music and audio engineering at Portland Community
                            College. During these years I played in various bands, ranging from live instrumentational
                            hip hop to jazz improv. Monetarily my best gigs were with cover bands playing Motown music.
                        </p>
                        <p>The music industry is an extremely difficult business to make a steady living. Forty years
                            ago, before the age of the internet and streaming, a musician could make a living playing
                            gigs and not have to ascend to rockstar status to pay the bills. Today the business has
                            become much more of a grind, and as a result the idea of the middle-class musician has
                            become less feasible, with most professional musicians having to work day-jobs to support
                            themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today I play music for my enjoyment, if I ever make money from it then it’s all gravy. The
                            music I compose now is often eclectic as are my tastes. Some of my songs are classical in
                            nature, others are funk driven and contemporary. I love exploring electronic sounds using
                            MIDI, it’s a powerful tool to leverage virtual studio technologies (VST) to create limitless
                            ranges of synth tonalities.

                        <p class="lead">
                        <p>My current major in college is psychology, with a minor in computer science. I love
                            psychology because the human mind is still to this day a mystery in many ways. Much like a
                            blackhole, the mind is a powerful entity that we can only make inferences about based on
                            observation. Many details of what lies inside, what creates our personal realities, our
                            consciousness, remain hidden so far. For these reasons, cognitive psychology is by far my
                            favorite subject in psychology.</p>
                        <p>After taking computer science classes at the UW for my minor, I realized that I not only
                            really enjoyed it but also had some aptitude for it. As a result, I’m currently working
                            toward a double major in Applied Computing and Psychology. I’m currently interning at PAC
                            Worldwide in the Global Information and Systems Technologies branch, expanding my knowledge
                            of network architecture, cloud computing, system administration, and cybersecurity.</p>
